#' Package Management with GitHub
#'
#' The factverse package provides a simple way to distribute
#' packages using private GitHub repositories.
#'
#' The main functions are:
#'
#' - [get_available_packages()]: Get a list of all packages
#' that you can install with factverse.
#' - [describe_package()]: Packages provided by factverse are typically
#' not public. `describe_package` provides a glimpse into what each package
#' does by downloading the README or DESCRIPTION.
#' - [install_essentials()]: Install all packages that are
#' essential for your work.
#' - [install_package()]: Install a specific package available
#' from factverse
#' - [check_for_updates()]: Check if there are newer versions available
#' for the packages you installed with factverse.
#' - [update_packages()]: Update all your packages that were
#' installed with factverse
#'
